The Post Listing App is a simple web application built with React.js that allows users to browse a list of posts fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching and viewing posts based on their titles.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for posts by typing keywords in the search bar. The app filters the list of posts dynamically based on the search query, displaying only the posts that match the entered keywords.

- **Real-Time Filtering**: As users type in the search bar, the list of posts is filtered in real-time, providing instant feedback and allowing for a smooth and responsive user experience.

- **Static Navbar**: The app features a static navigation bar at the top, providing easy access to the search functionality. The navigation bar remains fixed in place as the user scrolls through the page, ensuring convenient access to key features at all times.

- React.js: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
